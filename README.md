# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This purpose of this project was for my team and I to determine the number of retiring employess per their title; as well as identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This project supports the manager at Pewlett Hackard to prepare for current employees facing retirement.

# Results

* First Deliverable
  * we were challenged with finding the various titles for about to be retirees, if they were born from 1952 to 1955
  * Then we found more details on the retirees and created a table that found their employee number, name, and recent title (visually appeasing)

 * Then we made a count of the total number of retiring titles. There are more senior staff then all other positions at this company.

We joined the Employee and Titles tables, using folks who was born in 1965, as well as their name, employee number, and title and created and eligibility       mentorship table


# Summary
 The number of retiring employees per title are 90398, or around 64% of their workforce. With this major employee absence ahead of them, Pewlett Hackard will neeed to begin massive hirings and immediately implement a better mentorship program as not enough employees are currently eligible to mentor unless they mentor mulitple incoming new hires at a time. There are only 1550 eligible mentors available and with a large number of employees facing retirment. Pewlett Hackard will have to strategize a way to fill the employee vacancys while still running day to day operations. Hard times are ahead for current employees.
