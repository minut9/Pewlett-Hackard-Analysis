# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This purpose of this project was for Bobby and I to determine the number of retiring employess per their title; as well as identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This project supports the manager to prepare for current employees facing retirement.

# Results

* First Deliverable

  * Then we found more details on the retirees and created a table that found their employee number, name, and recent title (visually appeasing)
